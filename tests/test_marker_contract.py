"""Collection contract for the live ``@pytest.mark.sidecar`` suite (M0.5).

``sidecar.yml`` runs the live parity/round-trip suite in the *isolated* sidecar
env (``numpy<2`` / PyQt5, no base GUI/IO stack), so a repo-wide ``pytest -m
sidecar`` aborts at collection when it imports a base-only module (e.g.
``tests/test_movie_panel.py`` -> ``tifffile``). The job therefore scopes
collection with a ``tests/test_*sidecar*.py`` glob.

This module is the base-matrix guard that keeps that glob honest: every test
module that *actually* applies the ``sidecar`` marker must live in a file the
glob matches, so a new sidecar test can never silently escape the live job.
Detection is AST-based (not a text grep), so docstring/comment mentions of the
marker are ignored -- only real ``pytest.mark.sidecar`` references count.
